    "\n",
    "Create a deck of cards class. Internally, the deck of cards should use another class, a card class. Your requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deck class should have a deal method to deal a single card from the deck\n",
    "\n",
    "After a card is dealt, it is removed from the deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)\n"
