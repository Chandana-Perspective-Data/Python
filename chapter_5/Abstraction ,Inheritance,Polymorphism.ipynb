In this case, we can hide the unnecessary data from the user and expose only that data that is of interest to the user. This is called abstraction.\n",

    "A good example for abstraction is a car. Any car will have some parts like engine, radiator, battery, mechanical and electrical equipment etc. The user of the car (driver) should know how to drive the car and does not require any knowledge of these parts. For example driver is never bothered about how the engine is designed and the internal parts of the engine. This is why the car manufacturers hide these parts from the driver in a separate panel, generally at the front of the car."

    "Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the implementation details of a program from the user, and exposing only the necessary information to interact with it. This helps to make code more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to achieve abstraction in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1..Using functions: Functions allow you to group together a set of related statements, and hide the implementation details behind a single function call. For example, a function that calculates the area of a circle could take a radius as an input, perform the necessary calculations, and return the area, without the user needing to know the specific details of how the calculation is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "2..Using classes: Classes allow you to create objects that have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). By defining classes, you can encapsulate the data and behavior of an object, and hide the implementation details behind the class definition. For example, a class that represents a bank account could have methods for depositing and withdrawing money, without the user needing to know the specific details of how the transactions are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3..Using modules: Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files, and hide the implementation details behind the module import statement. For example, a module that defines a set of utility functions could be imported into another script, allowing the user to use the functions without needing to know the specific details of how they are implemented."

    "# 4. Inheritance\n",
    "Creating new classes from existing classes, so that the new classes will acquire all the features of the existing classes is called Inheritance. A good example for Inheritance in nature is parents producing the children and children inheriting the qualities of the parents. Let's take a class A with some members i.e., variables and methods. If we feel another class B wants almost same members, then we can derive or create class B from A as:\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "Now, all the features of A are available to B. If an object to B is created, it contains all the members of class A and also its own members. Thus, the programmer can access and use all the members of both the classes A and B. Thus, class B becomes more useful. This is called inheritance. The original class (A) is called the base class or super class and the derived class (B) is called the sub class or derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three advantages of inheritance. First, we can create more useful classes needed by the application (software). Next, the process of creating the new classes is very easy, since they are built upon already existing classes. The last, but very important advantage is managing the code becomes easy, since the programmer creates several classes in a hierarchical manner, and segregates the code into several modules."
