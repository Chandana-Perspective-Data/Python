    "PROBLEM STATEMENT (SOLVE ANY ONE FROM THE TWO GIVEN PROBLEMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First Problem: Without UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Management app\n",
    "\n",
    "Students have to create models, db and APIs all based on their understanding, we are just looking for a system that is able to accomplish the following tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an app (to be used with postman for api calls) which allows user to :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign up (take basic details such as name, gender, date of birth etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Log in (use django authentication)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following APIs can be called only once the user has logged in\n",
    "\n",
    "View a list of teammates\n",
    "\n",
    "View a list of teammates with a particular sorting order |\n",
    "For example, api call would look like this GET api/teammates?sort=name\n",
    "This would give a list of teammates’ names sorted by name\n",
    "Similarly you can be creative and add a number of filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Call an api to assign a task to a user by passing the id of the user and the content of the task in api call body\n",
    "i.e. POST api/assignTask/{userId} as the api end point and body as JSON:\n",
    "{task: “string that explains the task”}\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task will be in a particular status, on assignment, it is set to be “To-Do”, there should be APIs to change that status. Status can be one of the following:\n",
    "“To-Do”, “In-Progress”, “Done”\n",
    "\n",
    "A logged in user should be able to get a list of tasks assigned to him by an API call and change their status by making the change status API call\n",

    "\n",
    "Dairy Management App\n",

    "A logout button that makes the api call to end the session and redirects to the login page\n",
    "\n",

    "On clicking “New Entry”, user should be redirected to a page where there are 2 fields\n",
    "- An input field with “Heading” as the label and 200 character limit\n",
    "- A textarea where user can make the diary entry\n",
    "- A submit button on click of which, the heading and the content gets saved as a new entry with the date in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "On clicking any of the diary entry link on the main page, the user gets redirected to another page where the heading and the content can be read by the user but not edited, i.e. it is a read-only view for the user’s entry\n"
