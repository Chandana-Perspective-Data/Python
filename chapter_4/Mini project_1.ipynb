    "Create a sign up system. On starting the app, it should ask user of they want to log in or sign up (By pressing 1 or 2)\n",
    "If a user decides to sign up , ask for a username and password and save them in a file called passwords.txt\n",
    "For example:\n",

    "The user should be able to make a diary entry.\n",
    "User can press three “Enter”s in a row to stop making the entry\n",

    "This script is a simple implementation of a diary application where users can sign up, log in, and create diary entries. Upon execution, the script presents the user with a main menu with three options: log in, sign up, and exit. If the user chooses to sign up, they are prompted to enter a username and password, which are then stored in a text file. If the user chooses to log in, they are prompted to enter their username and password, which are then verified against the stored credentials. If the user is successfully logged in, they are presented with a user menu where they can read their diary entries, make new diary entries, or log out. The diary entries are stored in individual text files within a folder named after the user."
